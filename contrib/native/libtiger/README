 libtiger


This is libtiger, a rendering library for Kate streams using Pango and Cairo.

libtiger is a work in progress, and doesn't support everything Kate streams
can do, and may render some streams incorrectly. Likewise, the API is subject
to change without notice.

The latest version of libtiger can be found at:

http://libtiger.googlecode.com/

A Git repository can be found at:

http://git.xiph.org/?p=users/oggk/tiger.git;a=summary

The latest version of libkate can be found at:

http://libkate.googlecode.com/

Typically, Kate streams would be rendered as overlays over a video, for, eg,
movie subtitles.
