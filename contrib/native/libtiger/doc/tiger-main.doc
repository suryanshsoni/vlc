\section Introduction

This is the documentation for libtiger.

libtiger is a rendering library for Kate streams using Pango and Cairo.

The latest version of libtiger may be found at <http://libtiger.googlecode.com/>.

The Kate bitstream format is a timed text codec designed for embedding
in an Ogg bitstream. It was originally designed for karaoke and text.
The Kate bitstream format is documented in the libkate documentation.

Typically, Kate streams would be rendered as overlays over a video, for, eg,
movie subtitles.

The libtiger source is thread safe, as long as a single thread accesses
a given tiger_renderer object. However, Pango and Cairo are not themselves
fully thread safe, so using libtiger concurrently from different threads
may cause problems. Refer to Pango and Cairo documentation for more details
about using them in multithreaded programs.
